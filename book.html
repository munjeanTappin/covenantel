     rhetoric can be created to describe influence or impress a reader but the truth of how a god is formed is simple
     <br />  maximum potential requires 100% effort 100% of the time and this endeavor will be unceasing<br />
      the duration of the transformation from mediocracy to true brillance is simple and detailed in the bible as reiterated later on<br />
