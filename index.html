     ceo covenantel <br />
        secretary ngelyon
      </p>
      <hr size="3" noshade />
      <p>
        ngelyon is the supportive parent company that i manage while with-in covenantel I create and express myself
      </p>
      <p>
        covenantel is multi aspected and provides an artistic expression through the help of ngelyon
      </p>
      <p>
        through the fortune of faithfulness and love I have been joined unto a different path of life that continues indefinetly to nurture educate and elevate
      </p>
      <p>
        ngelyon elohym created this paradigm <a href="book.html">(the formation of a god)</a> presumably in order to create a high functioning human being in his likeness <br /> whose standards reflect his own thus creating living images of himself which would be a pleasure to live amongst <br /> and it is an honor to walk this path and also learn how to manage and express myself in a proper manner
      </p>
      <p>
        although elohym's walk of life is the most challenging and structured in every aspect all that is needed to begin and continue this walk is listed below
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://torah.org/learning/basics-primer-torah-bible/">bible</a>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        the bible is a singular book created to provide all the information that is needed for completion<br /> but the bible alone cannot complete <br /> the heart is the determining factor for success<br /> and yhwh elohym is the nahtsahkh and without him we languish into inferiority or nothing at all
      </p>

      <h2> <em>decisions</em></h2>
      are required the moments we wake up to the moments we rest from the duration of life until completion<br />there is always and only two ways of doing anything<br />with awareness and thought if we consider the opposing paths of life a decision can be made to refelect the outcome we want<br />without consideration the action still becomes part of our habits but inadvertently opposed to a purposeful decision
<h3> decisions are a continual</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    ascent
  </li>
  <p><em>or</em>
  </p>
  <li>
    mediocracy
  </li>
  <p>
    which leads to degradation that leads to descension
